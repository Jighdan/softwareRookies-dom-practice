# DOM Practice

## Requirements

### Table should be dynamic

Starts empty, new rows and columns should be created when pressing the New Row and New Column buttons. The first row is considered the header of the table.

### Table should be sortable

When clicking on a header, the table should sort by the values on that column. For example, if you click on Id column, then the whole table should sort by the values in that Id column.

### Cells should be editable

When double clicking on a cell, it should get into the 'Editing' mode and allow the value to be changed. When hitting enter, it should get out of the 'Editing' mode and keep the new value.

### Table should be paginated

When the table has more than 10 records, the exceeding records should not be seen on the first page, but when you click on the next page. Should be able to go the the previous page as well. Should not try to go to a page that does exist (pagination buttons should activate and deactivate based on that logic). Pagination bar should have Previous, 1, 2, 3, ..., Next buttons.

### Cells should be typed

When clicking on `New Column`, a modal form should pop up to specify the type of that column. The form should have the following fields:

- Header: the text that will show up in the header (like Id, Name, Age, etc).
- Type: (can be number, string, email, url). This is to format the table accordingly. 
- - If it's an url, then when Ctrl + left clicking on the cell, it should take you to that link. 
- - If it's an email, it should open the mailto option to send an email. 
- - If it's a number, it should right align the context of the cell.
- - If it's a text, it should left align it.

Editable: if the cell will get into the editable mode when double clicking. The field should be a checkbox.

### Columns and Rows should be orderable

When you click on a column header and start to drag it, that column should be able to move from one position to another. For example, if we have columns Id, Name, Age, and I want to move Age to the second position, I should be able to hold it and drag it to the second position so the columns should now be: Id, Age, Name.

When pressing Ctrl + left click on a row, this row should now be draggable and can be moved to another position.

### Table content should be saved in localStorage

Every time a change is made on the table (a new row, a new column, cell edit, etc.) it should be saved in localStorage. The table should a JavaScript object representation.

When the page is reloaded, the first thing that it should do is to try to get the table JavaScript object representation from the localStorage and recreate the table from there. If the table is not in the local storage, then simply create an empty `<table></table>` and get ready for New Row and New Column events.

### Rows should be selectable

The first column should be a checkbox to select that specific record or multiple records or all the records. This checkbox column should be created by default for all rows.

Delete button should be disabled by default. Only when at least on row is selected, the Delete button should be active. When clicking on this Delete button, the selected row(s) should be deleted.

### Table and buttons should look nice

Use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No library is allowed.
